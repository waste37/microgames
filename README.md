# MicroGames

Given the hyper complex state of the art in the software industry, i found myself in the need to explore simplicity.

This project has two main objectives:
1. Getting better at writing simple software
2. Showing that software can be *really* simple

The rules are:
* Make a game in a single file, make it fast and small
* Prioritize data over code aesthetics and abstraction
* Have fun
